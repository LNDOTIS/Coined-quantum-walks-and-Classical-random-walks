# Coined-quantum-walks-and-Classical-random-walks
This repository contains simulations and visualizations of **coined quantum walks** and **classical random walk** within the scope of my bachelor's thesis.

***Note:*** The simulation for quantum walk is conducted by using **Hiperwalk** package with **HPC** support. The implementation for **coined quantum walks** is adapted from the quantum walk models available at: https://github.com/hiperwalk/hiperwalk/tree/master/examples/coined

You can install **Hiperwalk** package at: https://hiperwalk.org/docs/stable/install/index.html 

This repository focuses on:
- Classical random walks on line (biased and symmetric)
- Coined quantum walks on a 5-dimensional hypercube
- Quantum walk search on a 5-dimensional hypercube
